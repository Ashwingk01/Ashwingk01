## Projects

### Prediction of Epigenomes from Human Genome Sequence using Deterministic Models
- **Duration:** 09/2022 â€“ 09/2023
- **Description:** Designed a deterministic model using R scripting for predicting epigenomes from the mouse genome GRCm38, incorporating statistical methods for model validation. Utilized R packages like Genomic ranges and Biostrings for efficient handling and operations on genomic intervals, facilitating cloud-based data processing.

### Segmentation Classification of Mouse Wound Healing in Histology Images Using Deep Learning
- **Duration:** 09/2022 â€“ 09/2023
- **Description:** Utilized TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit Learn, and SciPy for precise segmentation of mouse wounds, integrating decision-making algorithms into the software development process. Employed Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, enhancing model performance on diverse histopathological images and leveraging relational databases for efficient data storage. Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Scikit Learn, optimizing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for precise segmentation, collaborating with team members using Git for version control and effective communication.

### Comprehensive Analysis of RNA-Seq Data to Understand Molecular Interactions in Rheumatoid Arthritis
- **Duration:** 01/2021- 06/2021
- **Description:** Analyzed RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis patients using the Galaxy server, employing relational databases for data storage and querying. Investigated molecular interactions and potential therapeutic targets using network analysis tools, integrating CI/CD pipelines for automated data analysis workflows.
